## Interaction Log

### 13:47:30 - CLAUDE.md commit policy update
**User Request**: Change instruction in CLAUDE.md so Claude only commits when asked to do that

**Planned Steps**:
1. Read current CLAUDE.md file
2. Add commit policy section to Key Development Guidelines
3. Make the instruction clear and prominent

**What Actually Happened**:
- Read CLAUDE.md file successfully
- Added new "Commit Policy" section before "Asset Path Integrity"
- Added clear instruction: "Only commit changes when explicitly requested by the user"
- Added secondary instruction: "Never commit automatically or proactively without explicit user instruction"

**Result**: CLAUDE.md updated with clear commit policy at lines 92-94. Claude will now only commit when explicitly asked.

### 13:47:45 - Journal creation reminder
**User Request**: Pointed out that I missed creating a journal

**Planned Steps**:
1. Create .ai-journal directory if needed
2. Get current git commit hash
3. Create journal file with proper naming convention
4. Document the session activities

**What Actually Happened**:
- Created .ai-journal directory
- Retrieved commit hash: bb2a1a719dfbe66e5ea72583dd01fb2a64872752
- Created journal file: 2025-01-16-17-47-30-claude-md-commit-policy.md
- Documented both interactions in the journal

**Result**: AI journal system properly initialized and session activities documented.

### 13:48:15 - Journal structure improvement
**User Request**: Restructure journal to have planned steps, what happened, and results for each interaction instead of global planned steps

**Planned Steps**:
1. Modify journal structure to be interaction-focused
2. Add "Planned Steps", "What Actually Happened", and "Result" sections for each interaction
3. Update Summary to be a resume of all interactions with impact

**What Actually Happened**:
- Updated journal structure to track each interaction individually
- Added detailed breakdown of planned steps, execution, and results for each interaction
- Restructured to provide better tracking of session progress

**Result**: Journal now provides comprehensive per-interaction tracking with clear outcomes and impact assessment.

### 13:49:00 - Update CLAUDE.md with new journal template
**User Request**: Put the improved journal template into CLAUDE.md

**Planned Steps**:
1. Locate the Journal File Structure section in CLAUDE.md
2. Replace the old template with the new interaction-focused structure
3. Update the template to include Planned Steps, What Actually Happened, and Result sections
4. Document this change in the journal

**What Actually Happened**:
- Found and updated the Journal File Structure section (lines 125-153)
- Replaced old template with new interaction-focused structure
- Added detailed template showing Planned Steps, What Actually Happened, and Result format
- Updated Summary format to show Session Impact

**Result**: CLAUDE.md now contains the improved journal template that will be used for all future AI development sessions, ensuring consistent and comprehensive documentation.

### 13:48:25 - Add UTC date command to CLAUDE.md
**User Request**: Fix incorrect date usage and add proper UTC date command to CLAUDE.md for cross-platform compatibility

**Planned Steps**:
1. Check current UTC date using the correct command
2. Add UTC date command for macOS/Linux to Journal Commands section
3. Add Windows equivalent command for cross-platform support
4. Update journal filename to use correct UTC timestamp

**What Actually Happened**:
- Executed `TZ=UTC date "+%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"` and got correct UTC timestamp: 2025-08-16-13-48-23
- Added UTC date command to Journal Commands section in CLAUDE.md (lines 168-169)
- Added Windows PowerShell equivalent for cross-platform support
- Renamed journal file from incorrect timestamp to correct UTC timestamp
- Updated journal creation time to match correct UTC time

**Result**: CLAUDE.md now contains proper UTC date commands for both Unix-like systems and Windows, ensuring consistent journal file naming across platforms. Journal file corrected to use proper UTC timestamp.

### 13:50:15 - Fix commit hash reference in CLAUDE.md
**User Request**: Change CLAUDE.md description to clarify that commit hash should be from origin/main, not current branch

**Planned Steps**:
1. Update journal template to specify "last commit hash from origin/main"
2. Update journal commands to use `git log -1 --format="%H" origin/main`
3. Document this clarification in the journal

**What Actually Happened**:
- Updated journal template commit hash description from "current git commit hash" to "last commit hash from origin/main"
- Modified journal commands to use `git log -1 --format="%H" origin/main` instead of just current commit
- This ensures journal references the baseline from main branch for proper diff tracking

**Result**: CLAUDE.md now correctly specifies that journal should reference origin/main commit hash, providing proper baseline for tracking changes during development sessions.

### 13:52:30 - Restructure documentation and create engine.md
**User Request**: Reduce gitmoji descriptions, remove component descriptions from CLAUDE.md, and create ./for-LLMs/engine.md with comprehensive engine documentation

**Planned Steps**:
1. Reduce gitmoji descriptions to be more concise like the examples
2. Create ./for-LLMs/ directory if needed
3. Create ./for-LLMs/engine.md with comprehensive engine documentation
4. Remove component descriptions from CLAUDE.md
5. Add reference to engine.md in CLAUDE.md
6. Update journal with this interaction

**What Actually Happened**:
- Reduced gitmoji descriptions from verbose to concise format (e.g., "Configuration changes" â†’ "Configuration")
- Created for-LLMs directory
- Analyzed engine structure by reading Component/index.ts, Scene/index.ts, and GameObject/index.ts
- Created comprehensive engine.md covering: Components, Game Objects, Scene System, Input Devices, Utilities, Data Flow, File Structure Requirements, Development Guidelines, Testing Strategy, Performance Considerations, and Extension Points
- Removed component system descriptions from CLAUDE.md
- Added reference section pointing to engine.md with requirement to document new artifacts there

**Result**: Documentation is now properly separated with CLAUDE.md focused on development workflow and engine.md containing detailed technical architecture. Future engine development must update engine.md to maintain documentation consistency.

### 14:22:07 - Fix journal template and add semantic versioning
**User Request**: Fix journal template structure (move Summary after Interaction Log), use UTC timestamp function for interaction times, add semantic versioning description to CLAUDE.md, and update package.json version

**Planned Steps**:
1. Fix journal template structure - move Summary after Interaction Log
2. Update interaction time format to use UTC timestamp function
3. Add semantic versioning description to CLAUDE.md
4. Check last AI journal and update package.json version
5. Update current journal with correct interaction times

**What Actually Happened**:
- Updated journal template in CLAUDE.md to show Summary section after Interaction Log
- Updated template to use [UTC-Timestamp] format for interaction headers
- Added UTC time commands for interaction timestamps to Journal Commands section
- Added comprehensive Semantic Versioning section to CLAUDE.md explaining MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format and version update protocol
- Updated package.json version from 0.0.0 to 0.1.0 (MINOR bump for significant documentation improvements)
- Fixed all interaction timestamps in current journal to use proper UTC format

**Result**: Journal system now has correct structure with Summary before interactions, proper UTC timestamping, and project now follows semantic versioning with updated package.json to v0.1.0.
