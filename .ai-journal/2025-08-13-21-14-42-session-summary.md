# Activity: Session Summary - August 13, 2025

## Summary of Actions:
This session involved several key modifications to the project documentation, primarily `GEMINI.md` and `README.md`, based on user requests.

1.  **Updated `GEMINI.md`'s "Last Updated" Date:**
    -   The `GEMINI.md` file's "Last Updated" timestamp was updated from 2025-07-31 to 2025-08-13.

2.  **Recreated `README.md` with Relaxed Language and MBA Context:**
    -   The `README.md` file was completely rewritten to adopt a more relaxed and personal tone.
    -   It now includes an explanation that the project serves as a final paper for an MBA in Software Engineering at USP Brazil, incorporating emojis for a friendly feel.

3.  **Modified `README.md` to Explain `GEMINI.md` and Refine Language:**
    -   A new section was added to `README.md` to explicitly explain the purpose and importance of `GEMINI.md` as a guide for project collaboration and rules.
    -   The words "love" and "passion" were removed from the `README.md` content to align with the user's preference for specific language.

## Verification and Impact:
-   A `git diff HEAD` command was executed to review all changes made to `GEMINI.md` and `README.md`.
-   The `GEMINI.md` file now contains comprehensive guidelines for AI collaboration, including security, development workflow, testing protocols, and change documentation, along with updated technology versions and architectural details.
-   The `README.md` file provides a more engaging and informative introduction to the project, clearly stating its academic context and guiding collaborators to the `GEMINI.md` for detailed rules.

## Next Steps:
-   The project documentation is now more aligned with the user's specific requirements and provides clearer guidance for future development and collaboration.
