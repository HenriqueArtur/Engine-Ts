# 🚀 My Awesome Game Engine & Editor! 🎮

Hey there, fellow devs! 👋 Welcome to my project – a full-fledged game engine and editor built with some cool tech. This isn't just any side project; it's actually my final paper for my MBA in Software Engineering at USP Brazil! 🎓🇧🇷 So, yeah, a lot of effort (and late nights ☕) went into this.

## What's This All About? 🤔

This repository holds the code for a game engine and its accompanying editor. Think of it as my attempt to create a friendly environment for making 2D games, powered by:

*   **React:** For the slick editor UI. ✨
*   **TypeScript:** For type-safe, robust code. 💪
*   **Electron:** To wrap it all up into a desktop application. 🖥️
*   **PIXI.js:** For super-fast 2D rendering in the game runtime. 🚀

The idea is to provide a visual editor where you can drag, drop, and configure your game elements, and then have a lightweight runtime to play your creations. It's all about making game development a bit more accessible and fun! 🎉

## Important: Check out GEMINI.md! 📄

Before diving deep, please take a moment to read `GEMINI.md`. This file contains crucial guidelines, rules, and context for collaborating on this project, especially if you're an AI agent or just want to understand the project's conventions and security protocols. It's like our project's constitution! 📜

## Getting Started (Super Easy!) 👇

Want to take it for a spin? It's pretty straightforward:

1.  **Clone this repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Engine-Ts.git
    cd Engine-Ts
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:** I'm using `pnpm` for speed and efficiency!
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Fire it up!** This command will launch both the editor and the game runtime.
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

And that's it! You should see the editor pop up, ready for you to start creating. 🎨
